The overall design of the system is based on Jeff Thompson's Yield Prolog:

   http://yieldprolog.sourceforge.net/

although the system doesn't actually use any of his source code, and
isn't a compiler.

The reader is a transliteration into C# of Koen De Bosschere's
public domain C-language Prolog reader.

The Console window implementation is based on an EECS-399 by Lee Fan
of Northwestern University.

Eremic logic (aka exclusion logic) was developed by Richard Evans,
although the implementation here is original.
